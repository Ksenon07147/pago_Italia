# Pago Italia
My Diploma project of subject "Web Design and Development" with my group member. I learn a lot of HTML5,CSS and JavaScript basics on this project.<br>
Thanks to my group members, without you guys we can't complete this project on due date.<br>
The purpose of I started this respiratory is because I want to record the process when I was study in University. And also this can be my portfolio to interviewer as reference. :D

# Details of this project
This website simulate a website about a restaurant that provides Italian cuisine. This is a static website that build up by HTML,CSS and JavsScript.<br>
The restaurant also provides online order and delivery service so this project also have some JavaScript to run Shopping Cart function.

# Self-reflection
Our lecturer gives lower rating to my group

And I accept this result because of:

1) Lesser communication with groupmates. Because of this, we must separate our section and cause inconsistent design on each webpage.
2) The semester only got 8 weeks, and I lack studying on HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Because of this, the schedule is extended until before the due date. And the final product still buggy (JavaScript) when we submit up.

# The correction on this project

##### Updated on 20/June/2020 10:27pm MYT
I not only gonna upload this project only but also I want to do some correction about the structure of this project file to make it more tidy.

This is current Project structure:<br>
<img src="/images_for_readme/current_1.png" alt="Current structure of project" style="width:50%;height:50%"/>

<br>

As you can see, each webpages' elements are not integrate (seperate well). The elements,CSS and JS mixed together.<br>And each folder in different section have duplicate CSS and JS.(Thats why the design of the website are inconsistent) Pretty messy for me, and I wish I can tidy up the structure become this:<br>

<img src="/images_for_readme/after_1.png" alt="Structure of project after tidy up" style="width:50%;height:50%"/>
